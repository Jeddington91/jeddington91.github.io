      <p> My contribution to our groups senior capstone project involved developing the inner functionality of our device,
        while bringing together the hardware designed by my classmates with the software developed. As a computer engineer partnered
        solely with other electrical engineers, I was in a unique position to assist in both developing the software while also
        contributing to the design and function of the hardware.

        The goal of our solution was to automate the scrubbing of bathtub and shower ceramic, glass, or otherwise solid surfaces.
        Our team sought to improve on function and longevity the existing the automated Scrubbing Bubbles sprayer models, while
        being more cost effective than the more sophisticated window-cleaning robots it resembled in functionality. Utilizing vacuum power,
        in a simple system, we aimed to create a device that would attach itself to the walls utilizing suction and provide enough cleaning
        power to scrub the surfaces it traversed.

        The products navigational components met all the requirements, traversing the entire surface designated and stopping
        once it had finished. In anticipation of the suction components being completed, the navigation was mostly tested and
        developed along flat surfaces. The power delivered to the additive manufactured impeller was insufficient in keeping the
        combined weight of the vehicle and force of the scrubbers up. Utilizing transistors to supply more direct power to the
        impellers, reducing the weight of the construction material, even returning to the early design phase, and introducing a
        suspended cradle to the system.

        At the end of the term, uncertain the feasibility, or if the suggested corrections truly provide a convenient solution
        to the problem our team set out to solve, I chose to pursue the product no further personally. I am uncertain the
        productâ€™s fate with my colleague who initially proposed the project, yet remain proud of my contributions towards it and
        the experience it provided. In working with engineers with focuses in other fields, overcoming remote work and delayed
        supply chain obstacles, and experiencing a new side of C++ implementation in a real-world application, the project made
        me a significantly more well-rounded engineer.

        The slides to follow are a brief presentation and summary of progress given as part of a remote presentation at the end of
        our term. It includes the vehicles total progress at the time, what our team's next steps would be if pursuing the solution
        further, and summary of our market analysis and marketing roadmap.
