        <p>We are SO blessed! This past February 7th, we celebrated 10 years providing Eastern Colorado Springs
  	  with the finest optometry care available.  Thanks to the Eddington Eyecare family (yes, we think of you as
  	  family!) we have established a firm reputation for honest, caring eyecare delivery.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Anybody in the household 4 or older who hasn't had an eye exam in the last 2 years?
        We highly recommend that you schedule a routine eye exam with an optometrist near you.
        And no, a school screening does not count. Some over-refer, some under-refer, and generally
        none include a health exam to look for sight-threatening risk factors that down the road could
        lead to serious vision issues. Check your vision plan, amazing how many parents come in for
        their exams and don't give a thought to getting their children seen, even though they are
        paying for the insurance to provide an annual exam for the entire family! And for our active
        duty military friends, don't forget that Tricare Prime covers an annual exam (every 2 years for retirees)
        for all family members off base/post, no authorization or copay required!</p>
