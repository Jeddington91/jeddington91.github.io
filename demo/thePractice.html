	  Eddington Eyecare is a full-service primary care optometry practice,
	  including pediatric optometry, contact lens fitting, and the treatment and diagnosis of ocular disease.
	  An inventory of over 300 frames allows a style choice for even the most discriminating taste. We do not warehouse
    frames so that we can bring our patients the latest models every few months as they are released.  Our business is
	  located North of the baseball field (UC Health Park) across Barnes, near Pizza Hut.  The address is 6130 Barnes
	  Rd, Ste 128, adjacent to Pediatric Associates.  Just drive North on Tutt from Barnes and make 2 quick rights!
	  </p>
     <br />
	  <p>
	  Eddington Eyecare accepts most major insurance plans, including TRICARE, Veteran's Choice, EyeMed, VSP,
	  FEP Blue Vision, Davis Vision, Aetna, Cigna, Medicare and most Humana. Just give us a call and we can check with
	  your insurance company.
	  </p>
     <br />
	  <p>
	  Eddington Eyecare is proud to support those who are willing to risk their lives to defend us.
	  We offer a 10% "Defender" discount on all spectacle and contact lens purchases to families of active
	  duty/retired military, police and firefighters.
	  </p>
     <br />
	  <p>
	  Eddington Eyecare is truly a vision practice with a vision - to be a light in this community.
	  Our goal is not a patient to fill a slot, but a patient for life.  Come visit us and experience a vision
	  testing experience like you've never had before.  We also have a play area with toys for children while you or
      your family members receive your exams.
