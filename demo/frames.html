	Come in and browse our extensive collection of men's, women's and children's frames. We consistently update our inventory
  with the latest styles on the market to give a wide variety of frame styles and sizes to our patients. We work directly with
  insurance partnered, nationally recognized, optical labs which are hand-selected by our dispensing staff to give the widest lens
  options at the most affordable prices. We offer several packages and features to get you the highest quality lenses at the best price.
  </p>
    <br />

    Your lens choice begins with the best option for your lens material. CR-39 plastic is the standard lens material. We provide
    this as our most affordable option, but may recommend polycarbonate which is a lighter, thinner more durable lens dependent on
    individual needs. We also dispense trivex and other higher index plastics, which are especially useful for thinning lenses
    in stronger prescriptions. These materials can be cut into single vision lenses, bifocal or no-line, referred to as progressive,
    bifocals. The decision is ultimately each patients, but our doctor will likely make a recommendation on what may best suit each
    individual patient's needs.

    Certain additives are available for each lens as well. Some of our more popular are photochromic, or
    transition, lenses which darken in sunlight to give a sunglasses-like effect outside. Another is BluTech, which offers superior
    protection to blue light, the high energy visible light associated with eyestrain from extensive time on digital devices or screens.
    Artificial blue light is still being studied as it is a new factor with the age of digital electronics. Either of these options can
    be of great value for those who may be light sensitive or experience eye strain.
  </p>
    <br />
  <p>
    The last decision you will likely make for your lenses is whether or not you need an anti-reflective coating. Anti-reflective
    coatings come in a variety of purposes and functions, ranging from simple glare reduction useful for things like night driving,
    to additional color-spectrum control, giving more subtle relief from digital appliances and televisions. At Eddington Eyecare,
    our goal is to ensure that you are aware of all the options available to you and our recommendations of those options. We pride
    ourselves on the integrity of our dispensing process, and will never recommend something we do not truly believe beneficial to
    each individual patient's vision's needs.
